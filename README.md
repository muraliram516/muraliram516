## Applied Machine Learning Engineer | Python Developer

I design and build Python-based systems focused on applied machine learning and data-driven decision support.  
My work emphasizes production readiness, reliability, and aligning ML outputs with real-world business constraints.

### What I Work On
- Applied machine learning systems for classification and risk scoring
- Feature engineering and model evaluation for decision-focused ML problems
- Data preprocessing pipelines and ML inference workflows
- Python backend logic and REST-based integrations

### Technical Focus
- **Programming:** Python, SQL, JavaScript  
- **Machine Learning:** Applied ML, Supervised Learning, Classification, Regression, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation  
- **ML Systems:** End-to-End ML Pipelines, Data Preprocessing Pipelines, Model Inference  
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Backend & Deployment:** Flask, Streamlit, REST APIs  
- **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB  

### Engineering Principles
- Prefer simple, explainable models when decisions matter
- Choose evaluation metrics based on real-world cost of errors
- Design ML systems with stability, retraining, and data drift awareness
- Focus on clarity and maintainability over unnecessary complexity

### Interests
I am interested in roles involving:
- Applied Machine Learning Engineer
- ML Engineer (Production / Risk / Analytics)
- Data Scientist (Applied)
